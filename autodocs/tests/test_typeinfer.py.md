The `rewrite_generic` function is a generic function that is used to rewrite expressions in an abstract syntax tree (AST). It takes three arguments:

* `orig`: The original expression to be rewritten.
* `args`: A tuple of arguments to be passed to the expression.
* `updated`: A boolean indicating whether the expression has been updated.

The function first checks if the original expression is reachable.

If any of these conditions are met, the function rewrites the expression and returns it. Otherwise, the function returns the original expression.

The default implementation of the function will automatically create a new node if the children are updated; otherwise, it returns the original expression if its children are unmodified.

- `orig`: The original multiplication expression.
- `lhs`: The left-hand side of the multiplication.

The function's main functionality is to call the `binop_equiv` function with the following arguments:

- `opname`: "mul"
- `orig`: The original multiplication expression.

### function `rewrite_Unpack`

The `rewrite_Unpack` function takes three arguments: `orig`, `tup`, and `idx`. It creates a new type variable `tv` based on the `orig` argument. It then extracts the `idx` value from the `orig` argument and checks if it's an integer. If it's not, it checks the `orig_idx` value for a specific case. If it matches the case, it sets the `orig_idx` value to the constant and creates an equivalence between the `idx` and a new integer type.

The function then checks if the `orig_idx` value is an integer. If it is, it creates an equivalence between `tv` and a new `TupleGetitem` type with the `tup` and `orig_idx` values. Otherwise, it raises an exception.

Finally, the function returns the `tv` variable.
