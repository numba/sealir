## function `test_return_arg0`

The `test_return_arg0` function tests the functionality of the `udt` function. It creates a tuple of arguments `args` with values `(12, 32)`, and calls the `run` function with the `udt` function and the `args` tuple. The `run` function is not defined in the provided code, so its functionality is not documented here.
## function `test_return_arg1`

This function takes two integers as input and returns the second argument.

```python
def test_return_arg1():
    def udt(n: int, m: int) -> int:
        return m

    args = (12, 32)
    run(udt, args)
```
## function `test_simple_add`

The `test_simple_add` function performs a simple addition operation on two integers. It takes two arguments, `n` and `m`, and returns the sum of these two integers. The function does not perform any additional operations or modifications on the input arguments.
## function `test_chained_binop`

The `test_chained_binop` function performs a chained binary operation on two integers. It takes two arguments, `n` and `m`, and performs the following steps:

- Calculates `a` by adding `m` multiplied by 10 to `n`.
- Returns the value of `a`.

This function is similar to the `test_simple_add` function, but it includes the multiplication operation.
## function `test_inplace_add_1`

`test_inplace_add_1` tests the functionality of an inplace addition operation. The `udt` function performs the following steps:

1. Calculates the sum of the input arguments `n` and `m`.
2. Adds the value of `n` to the result of the previous addition.
3. Returns the final result.

The function is called with arguments `(12, 32)`, and the result is stored in `args`.
## function `test_multi_assign`

Assigns the sum of `n` and `m` to both `a` and `b`, then returns both values as a tuple.
## function `test_if_else_1`

The function `test_if_else_1` implements a simple utility function that takes two integers as input and returns the minimum value between them. It uses an `if-else` statement to determine the minimum value and stores it in the variable `out`.

```python
def udt(n: int, m: int) -> int:
    # basic min
    if n < m:
        out = n
    else:
        out = m
    return out
```
## function `test_if_else_2`

The `test_if_else_2` function takes two integer arguments, `n` and `m`, and returns a tuple containing two integers, `x` and `y`. The function first checks if `n` is less than `m`. If it is, then `x` is set to `n` and `y` is set to `m`. Otherwise, `x` is set to `m` and `y` is set to `n`. The function then returns the tuple `(x, y)`.

The function is used in the context of the codebase to compare two numbers and return the smaller of the two.
## function `test_if_else_3`

The function `test_if_else_3` takes two integers as input and assigns the larger of the two to both `a` and `b`. If the two integers are equal, both `a` and `b` are set to the value of the smaller integer. The function then returns the values of `a` and `b`.
## function `test_if_else_4`

Calculates and returns an integer value based on the values of `n` and `m`. It performs the following steps:

1. Calculates `a` by adding `n` and `m`.
2. Initializes `c` with the value of `a`.
3. Checks if `m` is greater than `n`.
   - If true, sets `a` and `b` to `n + m`.
   - If false, sets `a` and `b` to `n * m`.
4. Adds `a` to `c`.
5. Multiplies `b` to `c`.
6. Returns the value of `c`.

The function is called with two sets of arguments:
- `(12, 32)`
- `(32, 12)`
## function `test_while_1`

The `test_while_1()` function tests the functionality of a function called `udt()` that performs the following operations:

- Initializes two variables, `i` and `c`, to 0.
- Enters a `while` loop that iterates until `i` reaches `n`.
- Inside the loop, it calculates `c` by adding `i * m` to its current value.
- Increments `i` by 1.
- Returns a tuple containing `i` and `c` after the loop completes.

The function is called with two sets of arguments:
- `(5, 3)`: This sets `n` to 5 and `m` to 3.
- `(0, 3)`: This sets `n` to 0 and `m` to 3.
## function `test_range_iterator_1`

Iterates over a range of integers using `iter(range(n))`. It uses `next()` to retrieve the first two elements of the iterator and returns them as a tuple. 

**Functionality:**

* Takes an integer `n` as input.
* Creates an iterator over the range of integers from 0 to `n-1`.
* Uses `next()` twice to get the first two elements of the iterator.
* Returns a tuple containing the two elements.
## function `test_for_loop_reduce_add_1d`

This function tests the functionality of a user-defined function called `udt`. This function iterates through a range of integers from 0 to `n` and calculates the sum of these integers.

**Functionality:**

* Takes a single argument `n`, which represents the upper bound of the range.
* Initializes a variable `c` to 0.
* Uses a `for` loop to iterate through the range of integers from 0 to `n`.
* In each iteration, adds the current integer `i` to the variable `c`.
* Returns the final value of `c`.

**Testing:**

The function is tested with two different sets of arguments:

* `args = (5,)`: This tests the case where `n` is 5.
* `args = (0,)`: This tests the case where `n` is 0.

**Expected Output:**

* In the first case, the function should return 10.
* In the second case, the function should return 0.
## function `test_for_loop_reduce_add_2d`

The `test_for_loop_reduce_add_2d` function tests the functionality of a nested `for` loop that iterates over two dimensions. It calculates the sum of each pair of integers `i` and `j` where `j` is less than `i`.

**Functionalities:**

* Calculates the sum of each pair of integers `i` and `j` where `j` is less than `i`.
* Uses nested `for` loops to iterate over both dimensions.
* Returns an integer representing the sum of all pairs.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Test with an argument of 5
run(udt, (5,))

# Test with an argument of 0
run(udt, (0,))
```
## function `test_for_loop_reduce_add_2d_w_break`

This function tests a nested loop that calculates the sum of `i * j` for each pair of integers `(i, j)` where `j < i`, stopping the loop when the sum exceeds 20. 

The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer. It iterates over `n` integers, calculates the sum of `i * j` for each pair where `j < i`, and returns the sum. If the sum exceeds 20, the loop breaks.
## function `test_for_if_1`

The `test_for_if_1` function takes an argument `n` and performs the following steps:

* Initializes a variable `t` to 0.
* Iterates through a range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
* Inside the loop, it checks if the current iteration index `i` is greater than 2.
* If `i` is greater than 2, it defines a new variable `s` with a value of 123.
* In each iteration, it adds `i` to the `t` variable.
* Finally, the function returns both `t` and `s` values.

The function is called with an argument of `5`, which results in `t` being set to 10 and `s` being set to 123.
## function `run`

`run` is a function that takes a function `func` and its arguments `args` as input. It performs the following steps:

1. Calls `func(*args)` to get the expected result.
2. Restructures the source code of `func` using `restructure_source`.
3. Prints the Restructuring Verification System Difference Graph (RVS-DG) of the restructured function.
4. Asserts that `localscope` is `None`.
5. Uses `llvm_codegen` to compile the restructured function.
6. Calls the compiled function with the arguments `args`.
7. Asserts that the result of the compiled function is equal to the expected result.

The `run` function is used to test functions and ensure that they produce the expected results.
